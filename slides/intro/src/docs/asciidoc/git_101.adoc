== What is SVN?

.SVN System
[graphviz, svn-system, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-system.dot[]
--

* Single central server
* Local working copy
* No server, no commit, only local changes

=== How SVN Branch works?   

.SVN Branching
[graphviz, svn-branch, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-branch.dot[]
--

* Branch is a copy of a tree 
* Files are only linked  
* File is copied on write (Bubble up)
* trees <- SVN | GIT -> graphs

=== SVN Merge vs Reintegrate?

.SVN Merge   
[graphviz, svn-merge, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-merge.dot[]
--

.SVN Reintegrate
[graphviz, svn-reintegrate, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-reintegrate.dot[]
--     

* *Merge:* One up to all revisions
* *Reintegrate:* Always all revisions

== What is GIT?

.Git System
[graphviz, git-system, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-system.dot[]
--

* Distributed repositories
* Full repository available locally
* No server, still possible to merge/rebase/... 

=== How Git stores data?

.Git Data Storage
[graphviz, git-data-storage, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-data-storage.dot[]
--

* Versions are represented as a graph 
* Each version is a snapshot of the repository
* Snapshots contains referenced and changed files 

=== What is a Git Commit, Branch, Tag?

.Git Commit, Branch, Tag Example
[graphviz, git-commit-branh-tag, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-commit-branch-tag.dot[]
--
 
* A commit is a hash
* A commit can be labeled __(branch, tag)__
* A label is a pointer to a commit
* A tag is a immutable reference to a commit

=== How Git Branching works?

.Git Branch Model    
[graphviz, git-branch-model, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-branch-model.dot[] 
--

* *Master* branch holds released commits
* *Dev* branch contains unreleased commits
* *Feature* branch contains feature commits
* *Hotfix* branch contains hotfix commits

=== When Git Fast Forward?  

.Git Fast Fwd. Situation
[graphviz, git-fast-fwd-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-fast-fwd-1.dot[]
--

* Master branch hasn't diverged from hotfix branch
* Meaning, there are no commits in master branch, which are not in hotfix branch

=== How To Git Fast Forward?  

.Git Fast Fwd. Solution
[graphviz, git-fast-fwd-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-fast-fwd-2.dot[]
--

* Just an ordinary merge, but no merge commit necessary
* Commits moved from hotfix -> master branch
* Master pointer fast forwarded to last commit

=== When Git Merge?   

.Git Merge Commit Situation
[graphviz, git-merge-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-1.dot[]
--

* Master has diverged from hotfix branch
* But, both have a common ancestor

=== How To Git Merge?

.Git Merge Commit Solution
[graphviz, git-merge-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-2.dot[] 
--

* Merge of **C 4** and **C 5** via new commit
* New commit has two predecessors __(Merge Commit)__
* Merge commit automatically created __(If no conflict)__

=== When Git Merge Conflict?

.Git Merge Conflict Situation
[graphviz, git-merge-conflict-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-conflict-1.dot[]
--

* Master branch diverged from feature branch
* Master contains commits which feature branch doesn't
* Master and Feature branch have same resource modified

=== How Resolve a Git Merge Conflict?
    
.Git Merge Conflict Solution
[graphviz, git-merge-conflict-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-conflict-2.dot[]
--

* Just an ordinary merge, but:
.. Git pauses process __(Branch    changes are now local changes)__
.. Conflicts have to be manually resolved __(Each conflicting file)__
.. Merge commit is manually created __(Commit conflict resolution and changes!!)__

=== When Git Rebase?

.Git Rebase Situation
[graphviz, git-rebase-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-rebase-1.dot[]
--

* Master branch diverged from feature branch __(Same as Git Merge)__
* Rebasing does not create a merge commit
* Replays feature branch commit on master branch

=== How To Git Rebase?

.Git Rebase Solution 
[graphviz, git-rebase-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-rebase-2.dot[]
--

* Start at the common ancestor of *master and *feature* branch
* Replay *feature* branch commits on *master* branch
* Master branch pointer moved to new last commit via fast fwd.
* No merge commit (Cleaner history)

== Git 101 Hands On 

* How to work with git in development scenarios via the CLI?
* How and when to use branches?
* How to resolve merge conflicts?
* How to use the git workflow?

=== Scenario

.SwaggerUI Logo
image::./swagger-ui.png[]

* We want to integrate SwaggerUI in Openshift
* We want to manage the sources in Git
* We want to keep history of hotfixes

=== Scenario Developing Flow

.Scenario
[graphviz, git-scenario, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario.dot[] 
--

* Developers are separated by teams
* Developers work on features/hotfixes the same time
* Conflicts will sometimes occur
* Hotfixes need always to be merged!

=== Prepare a Git Repository

* We want to *create* a git repository for our sources
* We want to *initially* check in our sources
* Take the source provided

=== What has happened?

.Initialized Git Repository
[graphviz, git-scenario-1, svg]
-- 
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-1.dot[]
--

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=init] 
--

* Git created the *.git* directory and the *master* branch

=== Prepare the branches

* We want to implement the standard branch model *(master, dev, feature)*
* We want the *dev* branch to be the main branch
* We want the *feature* branch to hold nwe features 
* We want the *master* branch to point releases only

=== What has happened?

.Branch Model
[graphviz, git-scenario-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-2.dot[]  
--

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=branch-model]
--

* Pointer (Labels) have been created for the initial commit *(dev, feature)*
* Still, we have only one commit

=== Make the first release

* We want to *release* SwaggerUI the first time
* We want to ensure to keep the release state *immutable*

=== What has happened?

.First release tag  
[graphviz, git-scenario-3, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-3.dot[]
--

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=first-release] 
--

* A special Pointer __(Tag)__ has been created for the initial commit

=== Provide a fix for dev branch

* Someone has tried the dev branch and found a bug
* Seems the merge/pull request wasn't handled properly
* We want to provide a *fix* for the branch dev

.swagger.sh
[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/src/c_1/swagger.sh[tag=broken-function]
--

=== What has happened?

.Diverging branches
[graphviz, git-scenario-4, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-4.dot[]
-- 

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=fix-dev] 
--

=== Development on feature branch

* A new *feature* for providing a ssh private key via an env var has been requested
* We want the new feature to *not interfere* with others
* Unfortunately, our new feature will produce an *conflict*

.swagger.sh
[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/src/c_2/swagger.sh[tag=modified-function]
--

=== What has happened?

.Feature 
[graphviz, git-scenario-5, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-5.dot[] 
-- 
     
* Commits between branch *dev* and *feature* conflict
* For now, we have no problem, because we are on *different branches*
* We will have to *take care* of it, when we merge the conflicting branches

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=fix-dev] 
--

=== Provide a hotfix

* Operations has found a problem
* SwaggerUI load has increased the resource limits won't fit anymore
* We want to *fix it* by increasing the resource limits
* We want to ensure that the hotfix gets *reintegrated*
* The fix is for the *current* release

.swagger-full.yml
[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/src/c_3/swagger-full.yml[tag=newresource-limits] 
--

=== What has happened?

.Hotfix
[graphviz, git-scenario-6, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-6.dot[]
-- 

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=fix-hotfix] 
--

=== Finish the feature

* We have finished the feature development, so its time to merge
* We want to release our feature like *feature -> dev -> master -> tag*
* We want to *keep* the hotfix branch
* *Remember the conflict!!*

=== What has happened?

.Feature Release
[graphviz, git-scenario-7, svg]   
--
include::./graphviz/git-scenario-7.dot[]
-- 

[source,bash]
--
include::./examples/101/101.sh[tag=release-feature]
--

=== Further training needed?

* How to use the branching model with a Git server (E.g.: Gitlab)?
** How to design branches?
** How to do merge requests?
* How to use the fork model along with a branching model?
** How to combine fork and branching model?
** Advantages of the fork model?
** How to work with forked repositories?
