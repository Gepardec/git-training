== What is SVN?

.SVN System
[graphviz, svn-system, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-system.dot[]
--

* Single central server
* Local working copy
* No server, no commit

=== How SVN stores data?

* Versions are represented as a tree
* A branch is a copied folder
* Versions are series of changes

=== How SVN Branch works?

.SVN Branch
[graphviz, svn-branch, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-branch.dot[]
--

* Branch is a copy of a tree
* Files are only linked
* File is copied on write (Bubble up)
* SVN uses trees, not graphs

=== SVN Merge vs Reintegrate?

.SVN Merge
[graphviz, svn-merge, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-merge.dot[]
--

.SVN Reintegrate
[graphviz, svn-reintegrate, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/svn-reintegrate.dot[]
--

* Merge: One up to all revisions
* Reintegrate: Always all revisions

== What is GIT?

.Git System
[graphviz, git-system, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-system.dot[]
--

* Distributed repositories
* Full repository on workstation
* No server, no problem

=== How Git stores data?

.Git Data Storage
[graphviz, git-data-storage, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-data-storage.dot[]
--

* Versions are represented as a graph
* Each version is a snapshot
* Snapshots contains whole state

=== What is a Git Commit, Branch, Tag?

.Git Commit, Branch, Tag Example
[graphviz, git-commit-branh-tag, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-commit-branch-tag.dot[]
--

* A commit is a hash
* A commit can be labeled __(branch, tag)__
* A label is a pointer to a commit __(hash)__
* Multiple labels __(pointers)__ for a commit possible
* A tag is a immutable reference to a commit

=== How Git Branching works?

.Git Branch Model    
[graphviz, git-branch-model, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-branch-model.dot[]
--

* Master branch holds released commits
* Dev branch contains unreleased commits  
* Feature branch contains feature commits
* Hotfix branches contains hotfix commits

=== When Git Fast Forward?  

.Git Fast Fwd. Situation
[graphviz, git-fast-fwd-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-fast-fwd-1.dot[]
--

* Master branch hasn't diverged from Hotfix branch
* Meaning, no commits in Master which are not in Hotfix branch

=== How To Git Fast Forward?  

.Git Fast Fwd. Solution
[graphviz, git-fast-fwd-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-fast-fwd-2.dot[]
--

* Just an ordinary merge, but no merge commit necessary
* Commits moved from Hotfix -> Master branch
* Master pointer fast forwarded to last commit

=== When Git Merge Commit?   

.Git Merge Commit Situation
[graphviz, git-merge-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-1.dot[]  
--

* Master has diverged from Hotfix branch
* But, both have a common ancestor

=== How To Git Merge?

.Git Merge Commit Solution
[graphviz, git-merge-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-2.dot[] 
--

* Merge of **C 4** and **C 5** via new commit
* New commit has two predecessors (Merge Commit)
* Merge commit automatically created (If no conflict)

=== When Git Merge Conflict?

.Git Merge Conflict Situation
[graphviz, git-merge-conflict-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-conflict-1.dot[]
--

* Master Branch diverged from Feature branch
* Master Branch commits not in feature branch
* Master has same file changed as Feature branch

=== How Git Merge Conflict?

.Git Merge Conflict Solution
[graphviz, git-merge-conflict-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-merge-conflict-2.dot[]
--

* Just an ordinary merge but:
** Git pauses process __(Commit changes are now local changes)__
** Conflicts have to be manually resolved __(Each conflicting file)__
** Merge commit is manually created __(Commit conflict resolution an changes!!)__

=== When Git Rebase?

.Git Rebase Situation
[graphviz, git-rebase-1, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-rebase-1.dot[]
--

* Master branch diverged from Feature branch
* Same situation as with a Git Merge
* Rebasing does not produce a merge commit
* Replays Feature branch commit on Master branch

=== How to Git Rebase?

.Git Rebase Solution
[graphviz, git-rebase-2, svg]
--
include::./graphviz/git-rebase-2.dot[]
--

* Start on common ancestor of Master and Feature branch
* Replay Feature branch commits on Master branch
* Master branch pointer moved to new last commit via fast fwd.
* No merge commit (Cleaner history)
